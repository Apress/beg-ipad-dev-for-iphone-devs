Thanks for purchasing Beginning iPad Development for iPhone Developers!
I hope that you enjoy this book, and that the source code included here
helps you get the most out of this book.

The code for this book was written using a variety of Xcode versions as they became available. Just before going into print, I opened each project
using the latest release of Xcode (3.2.3) to verify that everything is in
working order, and everything seems to compile and run as expected.

However, Xcode is a moving target, and no description of its workings can
ever be completely perfect, so there are bound to be issues. If you come
across anything in the source code or text of the book that seems to be
incorrect or otherwise invalid, please let us know! Report errors on
the Apress website, or on the forums at http://iphonedevbook.com
